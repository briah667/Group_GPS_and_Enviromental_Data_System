# Group_GPS_and_Enviromental_Data_System
This project is not optimized. The orginal code was all done in Arduino IDE. 
The Raspberry Pi was used solely for sharing data between systems via the Cloud.
An Arduino Mega was used so that the GPS sensor could use a serial port and still have a serial port available to communicate with the Raspberry Pi. 
The main code is called PineconesSystemCode.
